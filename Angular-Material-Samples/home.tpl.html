    <h2>Welcome to Angular Material Code Samples.</h2>

    <pre>
        Many samples describe code to an extent within the browser. To get a complete picture, open the repository in an IDE of your
        choice. The code samples follow a simple folder structure. You will see a folder for each chapter. Browse through code
        samples for each chapter, under its folder.
